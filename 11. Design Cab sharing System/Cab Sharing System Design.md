# CAPACITY ESTIMATION

For Capacity Estimation, we will consider both **customers** and **cab drivers**. Here customers are the users who use cab sharing services for their rides.

## DAU MAU ESTIMATION

### For Customers

#### How many users are using your software?
- <strong>Daily Active Users</strong> (DAU) : ```36 million```
- <strong>Monthly Active Users</strong> (MAU) : ```180 million```

>__*Note:*__ DAU and MAU estimations for customers are considered from [Uber cab sharing Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20largest%20ridesharing%20company%20worldwide%20with%20over%20180%20million%20monthly%20active%20users%20and%206%20million%20active%20drivers%20and%20couriers.%20It%20coordinates%20an%20average%20of%2036%20million%20trips%20and%20delivery%20orders%20per%20day). If you want, then you can update these estimates as per your convenience.

### For Cab Drivers

#### How many cab drivers are using your software?
- <strong>Daily Active Users</strong> (DAU) : ```3 million```
- <strong>Monthly Active Users</strong> (MAU) : ```93 million```

>__*Note:*__ DAU and MAU estimations for cab drivers are considered as a rough estimate based on the Google search results. If you want, then you can update these estimates as per your convenience.

## Throughput Estimation

Calculation of write requests and read requests to the system

### For Customers

#### Write Requests

One of the possible ways of write requests to the system:
- Customer booking request information

Most of the cases, write requests are one time activities other than booking requests.

<strong>Assumptions</strong>:
- ```50 out of 100``` customers book rides daily.

<strong>Calculation</strong>:
- Total DAU: ```36 million```
- Write requests per day:
    - Booking : ```(50/100) times 36,000,000 = 18,000,000 ~ 18 million```

#### Read Requests

One of the possible ways of read requests to the system:
- Users track their ride.

<strong>Assumptions</strong>:
- ```55 out of 100``` users track their ride.

<strong>Calculation</strong>:
- Total DAU: ```36 million```
- Read requests per day:
    - Users track their ride: ```(55/100) times 36,000,000 = 19,800,000 ~ 19.8 million```

### For Cab Drivers

#### Write Requests

One of the possible ways of write requests to the system:
- Cab driver's booking acceptance/rejection information

Most of the cases write requests are one time activities other than booking and payment requests.

<strong>Assumptions</strong>:
- ```95 out of 100``` cab drivers accept rides daily.

<strong>Calculation</strong>:
- Total DAU: ```36 million```
- Write requests per day:
    - Ride acceptance : ```(95/100) times 36,000,000 = 34,200,000 ~ 34.2 million```

#### Read Requests

Some of the possible ways of read requests to the system:
- Cab drivers read their booking request.
- Cab drivers refer their ride history along with fare details.

<strong>Assumptions</strong>:
- ```95 out of 100``` cab drivers read their booking request.
- ```90 out of 100``` cab drivers check their ride history along with fare details.

<strong>Calculation</strong>:
- Total DAU: ```36 million```
- Read requests per day:
    - Cab drivers read their booking request: ```(95/100) times 36,000,000 = 34,200,000 ~ 34.2 million```
    - Users refer their ride history along with fare details daily: ```(90/100) times 36,000,000 = 32400000 ~ 32.4 million```

## Storage Estimation

### For Customers

<strong>Assumptions</strong>

- Average size of a cab sharing record: ```100 KB```
- Daily write operations to the system: ```18 million```

<strong>Storage Calculations</strong>

1. <strong>Daily storage requirement</strong>:
    ```100 KB x 18 million requests per day = 1.8 TB per day```
2. <strong>Storage requirement for 10-Years</strong>:
    ```1.8 TB per day x 365 days x 10 years = 6.57 PB```

### For Cab Drivers

<strong>Assumptions</strong>

- Average size of a cab sharing record: ```100 KB```
- Daily write operations to the system: ```34.2 million```

<strong>Storage Calculations</strong>

1. <strong>Daily storage requirement</strong>:
    ```100 KB x 34.2 million requests per day = 3.42 TB per day```
2. <strong>Storage requirement for 10-Years</strong>:
    ```3.42 TB per day x 365 days x 10 years = 12.483 PB```

        <td>3.42 TB/day x 365 days x 10 years</td>
        <td><strong>12.483 PB</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>

>__*Note:*__ Average size of a Cab Sharing user record - 100 KB is considered as a rough estimate. If you want, then you can update it as per your convenience.

## Memory Estimation

### Overview
By memory, we refer to the <strong>cache memory size</strong> required for faster data access.

### Why Cache Memory
Accessing data directly from the database takes time. To speed up data retrieval, cache memory is used.

### Cache Memory Requirement Calculation

#### For Customers

- <strong>Daily Storage Requirement</strong>: ```1.8 TB```
- <strong>Cache Requirement(1% of Daily Storage)</strong>: ```(1/100) x 1.8 TB = 18 GB```

#### For Cab Drivers

- <strong>Daily Storage Requirement</strong>: ```3.42 TB```
- <strong>Cache Requirement(1% of Daily Storage)</strong>: ```(1/100) x 3.42 TB = 34.2 GB```

>__*Note:*__ You may wonder, why we considered 1% of daily storage as cache requirement! This is because we need to store geo-spatial data only relevant to the user i.e. area closer to their location.

### Scalability
The memory size should scale as the system grows to accommodate increasing storage and data access demands.

## Network and Bandwidth Estimation

### Overview
Network/Bandwidth estimation helps us determine the amount of data flowing in and out of the system per second.

### Data Flow Estimations

#### For Customers

##### Ingress (Data flow into the system)

- <strong>Data stored per day</strong>: ```1.8 TB```
- <strong>Calculation</strong>: ```1.8 TB / (24 x 60 x 60) = 20.833 MB/sec```
- <strong>Result:</strong> Incoming Data Flow = ```20.833 MB/sec```

##### Egress (Data flow out of the system)

- <strong>Total read requests per day</strong>: ```19.8 million```
- <strong>Average customer record size</strong>: ```100 KB```
- <strong>Daily Outgoing Data</strong>: ```19.8 million x 100 KB = 1.98 TB/day```
- <strong>Calculation</strong>: ```1.98 TB / (24 x 60 x 60) = 22.92 MB/sec```
- <strong>Result</strong>: ```22.92 MB/sec```

#### For Cab Drivers

##### Ingress (Data flow into the system)

- <strong>Data stored per day</strong>: ```3.42 TB```
- <strong>Calculation</strong>: ```3.42 TB / (24 x 60 x 60) = 39.58 MB/sec```
- <strong>Result:</strong> Incoming Data Flow = ```39.58 MB/sec```

##### Egress (Data flow out of the system)

- <strong>Total read requests per day</strong>: ```66.6 million```
- <strong>Average customer record size</strong>: ```100 KB```
- <strong>Daily Outgoing Data</strong>: ```66.6 million x 100 KB = 6.66 TB/day```
- <strong>Calculation</strong>: ```6.66 TB / (24 x 60 x 60) = 77.08 MB/sec```

# API DESIGN

We follow a standard & efficient way to communicate between the cab sharing systems. Computers talk to each other through API call. So let's first try with REST API for this communication.

## API Design :Book A Cab

Let's say our user(Mark) wants to book a ride using a cab sharing company. Mark can send request to the cab sharing server, the cab sharing server can relay that request to cab driver(John). John can accept the ride, the cab sharing server can get the response from John, and then cab sharing server can pass the booking confirmation response to Mark.

![book a cab1](./Resources/bookACab1.png)

>__*Note:*__ Here, John can also reject the Mark's booking request. If so, Mark will have to repeat the process by re-initiating booking request.

### Let's look into the analogy of 'Mark booking a cab':
1. **User(Mark)** sends a booking request with his choice of pick-up and drop-off location(s) to the **Cab Sharing Server**.
2. The **Cab Sharing Server** maps booking request with a **Cab Driver(John)** who is near to the **Mark's pick-up location**.
3. **John** acknowledges the booking request with his acceptance or rejection and notifies to the **Cab Sharing Server**
4. The **Cab Sharing Server** relays that acknowledgement to **Mark**.

>__*Note:*__ The process of mapping cab driver involves micro-service gRPC communication and we will talk about that in High-level design.

#### First Part: Sending a booking request to the server

We can handle this with a simple REST API call (HTTP POST request).

Here are the technical details.

![book a cab2](./Resources/bookACab2.png)

### HTTP Method
This tells to the server what action to perform. Since we want to book a cab for a user on the server, we use the `POST` action.

### Endpoint
This tells the server where to perform that action. Since we are booking a ride for a user, we will use the `/v1/bookings` endpoint of the server.

>__*Note:*__ 'v1' means version 1. It is good practice to version your APIs. You can customize the endpoint based on your convenience.

### HTTP Body
We have told the server to book a ride for a user, but we haven't provided the details of the booking itself. This information is sent in the request body:

```json
{
    "userId":"Identification number of the user",
    "source":"pick-up location of the ride",
    "destination":"drop-off location of the ride",
    "cabType":"Type of the cab for a ride. E.g: Economy/Premium e.t.c",
    "BookingQuoteId":"Temporary booking Id for the ride"
}
```

#### Second Part: Relaying the message to the Cab Driver

This is more challenging. The Cab Sharing Server needs to send the message to John.

![book a cab3](./Resources/bookACab3.png)

#### Third Part: Relaying the message to the Cab Driver

If second step isn't through, then we can forget about the third part even though from client to server communication is possible through HTTP request.

#### Fourth Part: Relaying the message to the Cab Driver

So is the fourth part!

![book a cab4](./Resources/bookACab4.png)

__Problem__

In HTTP, the server cannot initiate requests to the user. Requests can only be sent **from the client to the server** - it's a one-way street (user -> cab sharing server).

__Solution:__ WebSockets

WebSockets enable __bidirectional__ communication.

>__*Note:*__ For more details, you can refer to our WebSocket section of [Communication Protocols](../Course%20Notes/03%20-%20Appendix/03%20-%20Networking%20Buzzwords/03%20-%20Communication%20Protocols_%20Rules%20for%20Computer%20Communication.md).

The below image represents the creation of bi-directional communication using a HTTP request.

![HTTP upgrade](./Resources/http_upgrade.png)

Once the connection is upgraded, it remains **open**, allowing both the cab sharing server and user/client to send messages directly to each other in **real-time** without needing the traditional HTTP request/response model.

- Mark sends messages to the cab sharing server through his connection.
- John receives messages from the cab sharing server through his connection.
- John sends messages to the cab sharing server through his connection.
- Mark receives messages from the cab sharing server through his connection.

![WebSocket connection](./Resources/webSocket_connection.png)

## API Design :Track The Ride

In the above API, we saw how Mark booked a ride. Now, let's see how Mark will track his ride.

We will continue with the WebSocket connection as __Track The Ride__ requires bi-directional communication and also a stream of messages from server to client.

<strong>Ride tracking involves the steps below.</strong>
1. Mark will wait for John's cab to arrive at the pick-up location.
2. John will start the ride after picking Mark from the pick-up location.
3. Mark and John will start tracking their ride along the way.

### First Part: How does the structure of data sent and received look like?

Imagine Mark is waiting at his pick-up point for John. He has no clue when John will arrive at his location. So, Mark opened the cab sharing application to get John's Estimated Time of Arrival(ETA).

Server will read the Mark's pick-up point and John's current location coordinates to calculate the ETA. After ETA calculation, server will share John's ETA to Mark's pick-up location with Mark.

![Wait for the cab](./Resources/waitForTheCab.png)

### Second Part: Data flow while starting an operation

Imagine John is at Mark's pick-up point. Mark got into John's cab now. They wanted to start the ride and John clicked start ride button in the cab sharing application.

Server will read the Mark/John's current and drop-off location coordinates to calculate the ETA to the drop-off location along with distance in miles. After calculation, server will share ETA to the drop-off location and distance between pick-up and drop-off locations to both Mark and John via cab sharing application.

![Start the ride](./Resources/startTheRide.png)

### Third Part: Live data flow after starting the operation

Let's assume Mark is curious to track his cab ride along with John. So, they both opened cab sharing application to track their ride.

Server will consider both Mark/John's current location and drop-off location coordinates continuously to calculate dynamic ETA, distance(in miles). It will asynchronously sending these updates to both Mark and John to track their ride along the way.

![Track the ride](./Resources/trackTheRide.png)

>__*Note:*__
>1. ETA calculation involves several steps which will get covered in the __Book A Cab__ high level design.
>2. __The map, ETA__ and __distance(in miles)__ in the above images are considered as an example. You can re-consider these factors as per your convenience.
>3. There can be more cases during this tracking process. Some of them are-
>    - Mark may change his pick-up location during __Wait For The Cab__ period. In this case-
>        - Server can notify both Mark and John about the dynamic change of John's ETA to Mark's location along with distance to reach.
>        - Server can give heads-up to John about Mark's new pick up location.
>    - Server can suggest __alternate ways__ to reach drop-off location by considering various factors, such as ETA, distance, traffic e.t.c.
>    - __During the trip__, Mark may change his __drop-off location__. In this case-
>        - Server can re-calculate ETA to the drop-off location along with relevant changes, such as price, alternate routes e.t.c.
>        - Server can notify these changes to both Mark and John.

## API Design :View Ride History

After dropping Mark at drop-off point, John thought of checking his ride history along with the payment information. So, John opened his Cab Sharing application and clicked __Activity__ option in his profile page.

Unlike previous API, we can use REST API (HTTP GET request) for viewing ride history. But, we will stick to the __WebSocket connection__ for API communication to avoid extra HTTP headers and also to maintain consistency.

![View ride history](./Resources/viewRideHistory.png)

Now, John is able to view his ride history including payment information. He can also view more details of a particular ride if needed.

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

# HIGH LEVEL DESIGN

Let's see what was happened in the __background__ when-
- Mark booked a cab,
- Mark and John tracked their ride,
- John viewed his ride history along with payment information.

In the API design, we saw how WebSocket connection can be used to communicate with cab sharing servers. If we go __a little deeper__, then we can see how __services communicate__ with each other.

For service communication, we can use __gRPC__.

google __Remote Procedure call__(gRPC) enables efficient communication between services using __proto buffers__ and __gRPC server__.
- Protocol buffers(an interface definition language) used to represent the __service interface__ and the __payload message structure__.
- gRPC server is used to __handle client calls__.

>__*Note:*__ We can relate gRPC to a general example [here](../Course%20Notes/03%20-%20Appendix/04%20-%20Communication%20Buzzwords/03%20-%20gRPC_%20A%20Restaurant%20Analogy.md)

## High Level Design :Book A Cab

Mark performed a couple of steps to book his cab. Let's dive into them one by one on a __high-level__.

### HLD :View Map

How Mark was able to view the map which allowed him to choose pick-up and drop-off points graphically? Below steps walk us through.

![Client API Flow](./Resources/HLDViewMap1.png)

1. Mark can tap the __Cab Sharing App__ icon on his mobile device(client) to open Cab Sharing Application.

2. The __Client__ can send view request to the __API gateway__ via WebSocket connection.
    - An API gateway acts as a single entry point for all incoming requests.
    *Note:* For more details, you can refer to our [API gateway template](../Course%20Notes/03%20-%20Appendix/01%20-%20The%20Ultimate%20System%20Design%20Template/10%20-%20API%20Gateway.md)

![API Gateway Service Flow](./Resources/HLDViewMap2.png)

3. The __API gateway__ can relay the request to the __load balancer__.
    - A load balancer acts like a traffic manager, directing incoming user requests to different servers.
    *Note:* For more details, you can refer to our [ultimate system design template](../Course%20Notes/03%20-%20Appendix/01%20-%20The%20Ultimate%20System%20Design%20Template/04%20-%20Load%20Balancer.md)

4. The __Load balancer__ can relay the request to the __Data Fetch__ service.
    - The Data Fetch service can take request and pass it to appropriate service within cluster for a response.

![Flow within Service Cluster](./Resources/HLDViewMap3.png)

5. The __Data Fetch__ service can relay the request to a Load balancer within the service cluster. The Load balancer can direct the request to a available __Map__ service.
    - The __Map__ service is responsible to manage map data.
    - There can be __multiple Map services__ to address multiple requests simultaneously.

6. The __Map Service__ can take help from __Map Database__ service to get the map details.
    - The __Map Database__ service is responsible for getting relevant map details and also for maintaining user's map information until the ride completes.

7. The __Map Database__ service can use S2 index to get user's region and also to find relevant database partition.
    - S2 is a library used to work with geographical data. For more details, refer to this [link](http://s2geometry.io/).

8. The __Map Database__ service can use this partition to download the map data from __key value storage__.
    - The __Key value storage__ is an example of __NoSQL__ database. For more details, refer to our [Database and Storage Basics](../1.%20System%20Design%20Basics/Database%20and%20Storage%20Basics.md)

9. The __Map Database__ service can relay the response to the __Map Service__.

10. The __Map Service__ can take help from the __GPS signal__ service to avoid the risk of missing road data.

11. The __Map Service__ can provide final map data output to the __Data Fetch__ service.

12. The __Data Fetch__ can save user's map information to the __user record__ database.
    - The __user record__ database is responsible for maintaining user's information.
        - Internally, you can implement __Cache Aside Strategy__ for read operations and __Write Aside Strategy__ for write operations as user's data storage has more importance in cab sharing system.
        *Note:* For more details on caching, refer to our [Caching Basics](../1.%20System%20Design%20Basics/Caching%20Basics.md).
            - As there is a chance of stale data, we can use [ZooKeeper service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_ZooKeeper) to maintain synchronization between database and its replica(s).

>__*Note:*__ Maintenance of multiple Map services can be dependent on no of user requests.

![API Response](./Resources/HLDViewMap4.png)

13. The __API gateway__ can send the response back to the __Client__. Now, Mark can view the booking page with a __Map view__.

14. The __Client__ can save map information to the __CDN__.
    - The __Content Delivery Network(CDN)__ stores copies of your website’s data that doesn’t change too often.
    *Note:* For more details on CDN, you can refer to the CDN section of [Database Storages](../1.%20System%20Design%20Basics/Database%20and%20Storage%20Basics.md).

15. We can use in-memory cache to __avoid__ additional __network data usage__ on duplicate download of map data by drivers.
    - __In-memory cache__ can help us to update data only if the server map data changes.

#### Final HLD for View Map:

![View Map Overall Flow](./Resources/HLDViewMapOverall.png)

#### Map Cache Flow

To provide map data with low latency, we can make use CDN effectively. The below image gives us an idea how CDN decreases latency in loading Mark's/John's Map details.

![View Map CDN Cache](./Resources/HLDCDNCache.png)

1. Mark thought of opening his cab sharing application and __Client__ can request __CDN__ for Mark's __Map information__. 
2. The __CDN__ worried because it doesn't have Mark's Map information, so it requested __Cab Sharing__ servers to provide relevant information.
3. The __Cab Sharing__ servers can get the __map data__ from __key-value__ storage 
4. The __Cab Sharing__ servers can provide the response back to the __CDN__.

>__*Note:*__ The Client can __validate__ the CDN __cache correctness__ based on various __factors__ such as Mark's or John's current location e.t.c.,

### HLD :View ETA

How Mark was able to view ETA to the drop-off point? Let's find out.

![User Request](./Resources/HLDviewETA1.png)

1. The __Client__ can get static Map data from __CDN__ for Mark and Mark can click __ok__ button after entering pick-up and drop-off points.

2. The __Client__ can send __view ETA__ request to the __API gateway__.

>__*Note:*__ When Mark clicks __ok button__, other options such as cab type e.t.c can also be considered, but we are not covering them in this design.

![API Load Balancer Flow](./Resources/HLDviewETA2.png)

3. The __API gateway__ can relay the request to __load balancer__.

4. The __Load balancer__ can direct the same request to __Data Fetch__ service.

![Initial Service Flow](./Resources/HLDviewETA3.png)

5. The __Data Fetch__ service can relay the request to the __Load Balancer__.
    - Here, Data Fetch service can __validate the input__ data __before relaying__ the request further.

6. The Load balancer can direct the request to a available __Ride Estimator__ service as shown in the image above.
    - The __Ride Estimator__ service is responsible to compute ETA by considering various factors which will be discussed in the steps below.
    - There can be __multiple Ride Estimator__ services to address multiple requests simultaneously.

![ETA Service Flow](./Resources/HLDviewETA4.png)

7. The __Ride Estimator__ service can send the map data request to a available  __Map__ service through a __Load Balancer__.

8. The __Map__ service can respond with the map data based on Mark's pick-up and drop-off points.

9. The __Ride Estimator__ service can use __deep learning algorithms__ to predict __traffic control elements__ such as stop signals and traffic lights.

10. The __Ride Estimator__ service can get average speeds (based on the locations) from __hash table__ through __Estimator Database__ handler.

11. The __Ride Estimator__ service can consider the map data as a __graph__ to compute accurate ETA.
    - In Map graph, a road intersection is considered as a node and a road segment is considered as an edge.
    - Let's say, road intersections are more in Mark's ride path. In this case, we can partition the Map graph to calculate ETA efficiently.
    *Note:* You can refer to this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) for more details on Graph.

12. The __Ride Estimator__ service can make use of __GPS signal__ service to get active & recent GPS observed points between Mark's pick-up and drop-off points.
    *Note:* For more information on GPS signals, you can refer to this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_signals)

13. Now, to get the __accurate ETA__, we can do __map matching__ between estimated and GPS observed points as shown in the image above.
    - In __Map matching__, if the estimated and GPS observed points don't match, then step 11 will be repeated with the ride path paired with GPS observed points and can skip step 12 and step 13.
    - The final calculated ETA data can be relayed back to the __Data Fetch__ service.

14. The computed __ETA__ along with user's details (such as user's current location, pick-up and drop-off points) can be registered in database through __Estimator Database__ handler for re-usability purposes.
    *Note:*
    1. Based on the business need you can limit or extend this storage.
    2. For instance, if you want to limit, then you can save only ETA associated to pick-up and drop-off points to the Ride Estimator Database. Also, you can consider this storage if Mark changes his drop-off location.

>__*Note:*__
>- We can store average speeds in a hash table for fast look-up.
>    - A hash table generalizes the simpler notion of an array. You can refer to our __hashing__ section of [Extras file](../1.%20System%20Design%20Basics/Extras.md) for more information.

![Response Flow1](./Resources/HLDviewETA5.png)

15. The __Ride Estimator__ service can provide computed ETA output to the __Data Fetch__ service.

16. The __Data Fetch__ service can __save ETA__ associated to pick-up and drop-off points to the __User Record__ Database. Also, you can consider this storage if Mark changes his drop-off location.
    *Note:* This storage cannot be required always unless you have a business need.

![Response Flow2](./Resources/HLDviewETA6.png)

17. The __API gateway__ can relay the response message to the __Client__.

18. Mark can view the __ETA__ on his booking page.

#### Final HLD for View ETA:

![ETA Overall Flow](./Resources/HLDviewETAOverall.png)

>__*Note:*__
>1. The average speed and ETA in the reference image are considered as an example. You can update them as per your convenience.
>2. While calculating ETA, __Haversine distance__ can be considered. Think of it like a formula to compute the shortest distance between two points on a sphere. More details are [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)
>3. As ETA can keep on changing between two locations based on various factors and also storage can be huge in case of ETA. So, we are not considering ETA storage for entire ride path. Instant communication can be preferred.

### HLD :Find A Driver

How Mark was able to find a driver for his booking? Let's look into it.

![User Request](./Resources/HLDfindADriver1.png)

1. The __Client__ can get static Map data from __CDN__ for Mark and Mark can click __Book__ button after knowing ETA to his drop-off point.

2. The __Client__ can send __booking__ request to the __API gateway__.
    - __Find A Driver__ request is a part of booking request.

![API Load Balancer Request](./Resources/HLDfindADriver2.png)

3. The __API gateway__ can relay the request to the __load balancer__.

4. The __Load balancer__ can direct the same request to the __Data Fetch__ service.

![Service Request](./Resources/HLDfindADriver3.png)

5. The __Data Fetch__ service can relay the same request to the available __Driver Finder__ service through a __Load balancer__.
    - The __Driver Finder__ service is responsible to find active drivers near Mark's location.

6. The __Driver Finder__ service can take help from the available __Map service__ through a __Load balance__ to get map data of available drivers locations.

![Driver Finder Service](./Resources/HLDfindADriver4.png)

- The __Driver Finder__ service can use Key-Value(Redis cluster) storage to store driver locations.
    - Redis key-value store is an example of NoSQL database. For more details, you can refer to [Database Concept](../Course%20Notes/03%20-%20Appendix/01%20-%20The%20Ultimate%20System%20Design%20Template/02%20-%20Database.md).
- The __Key Value Storage__ can have many __instances__, meaning driver locations are __distributed__ among all instances.
- We may encounter two issues with this storage:
    1. __Hot Shard Problems__
        - Hot Shard Problems can occur due to more drivers in big cities.
        - Solution:
            - We can use S2 library to divide a map into regions that can vary in size.
            - So that only few cars will fit inside a single shard.
        *Note:* For more details on sharding, you can refer to our __Database Sharding__ under [System Design Basics](../1.%20System%20Design%20Basics/Database%20and%20Storage%20Basics.md)

    2. __In-active Drivers__
        - The drivers who __stopped driving__ for the rest of the day.
        - Solution:
            - We can __create buckets__ to store __active drivers__ and can __remove__ old buckets with in-active drivers.
            - To avoid frequent memory access for allocation and de-allocation, we can use a __sorted set__ with latest timestamp to find nearby drivers.

![Driver Finder Response](./Resources/HLDfindADriver5.png)

7. The __Driver Finder__ service can relay a list of active drivers near to Mark's location to the available __Request__ service through a __Load balancer__.
    - The __Request__ service is responsible for sending requests to users and record their responses.

![Request Service Req1](./Resources/HLDfindADriver6.png)

8. The __Request__ service can send Mark's booking request to first driver(Kevin) in the active drivers list.

9. The __Client__ can relay Kevin's rejection message to the __Request__ service.

![Request Service Req2](./Resources/HLDfindADriver7.png)

10. As Kevin rejected the booking request, the __Request__ service can send Mark's booking request to John.

11. The __Client__ can relay John's approval message to the __Request__ service.

12. The __Client__ can save driver details to the __CDN__.

![Request Service Response](./Resources/HLDfindADriver8_1.png)

13. The __Request service__ can stop sending requests to drivers and can send confirmed Driver details to the __Driver Finder__ service.

14. The __Driver Finder__ service can update the ride status of John in database.
    - These details are useful in filtering out active drivers.

![Request Service Response](./Resources/HLDfindADriver8_2.png)

15. The __Driver Finder__ service can give response back to the __Data Fetch__ service.

16. The __Data Fetch__ service can store John's details associated to Mark's ride in __user record__ database.
    - These details are useful to maintain ride history.

![API Gateway Response](./Resources/HLDfindADriver9.png)

17. The __API gateway__ can send the response back to the __Client__ with booking acceptance message.

18. The __Client__ can retrieve John details from the __CDN__.
    *Note:* The Client can get the driver details from API gateway, but for faster load time, it can make use of CDN.

19. Now, Mark is __able to view__ driver details via Client.

### Final HLD for finding a driver:

![Find A Driver](./Resources/HLDfindADriverOverall.png)

## High Level Design :Track The Ride

How Mark and John were able to track their ride? Let's take a look.

![User Request](./Resources/HLDTrackTheRide1.png)

1. __User can start their ride__ through __Client__ device to initiate __tracking__.

2. The Client can __get static data__ from __CDN__ to populate on Client device.

3. The __Client__ can make use of web-socket connection to forward the request to the __API Gateway__.

![API Gateway Flow](./Resources/HLDTrackTheRide2.png)

4. The __API gateway__ can relay the request to the __load balancer__.

5. The __Load balancer__ can direct the same request to the __Data Fetch__ service.

![Data Fetch Request Flow](./Resources/HLDTrackTheRide3.png)

6. The __Data Fetch__ service can send the Map data request to the available __Map__ service through a __Load Balancer__.

7. The __Data Fetch__ service can send the ETA request to the available __Ride Estimator__ service through a __Load Balancer__.

![Ride Tracking Flow](./Resources/HLDTrackTheRide4.png)

8. The __Map__ service can take help from __Map Database__ handler to get the map details.
    - The __Map Database__ handler can use S2 index to get user's region and also to find relevant database partition.
    - The __Map Database__ handler can use this partition to download the map data from __key value storage__.
    - The __Map Database__ handler can relay the response to the __Map__ service.

9. The __Map__ service can take help from the __GPS signal__ service to avoid the risk of missing road data.

10. The __Map__ service can provide a copy of final map data output to the __Ride Estimator__ service for computing ETA.
    - The __Map__ service can send this information as per the request from the __Ride Estimator__ service.

11. The __Estimator__ service can use __deep learning algorithms__ to predict traffic control elements, such as __stop signals__ and __traffic lights__.
    *Note:*
    1. The traffic control elements will be considered only once between pick-up and drop-off points.
    2. If Mark changes either pick-up point (at the start) or drop-off point (at the end), then you can repeat this step to get updated data.

12. The __Estimator__ service can get location based average speeds from the hash table through __Estimator Database__ handler.

13. The __Estimator__ service can extract __GPS signal__ details for missing road information.
    - This information is useful, if the estimated path encounters any run time changes like John takes different route to reach drop-off location or Mark updates the ride with stopping points in between.

14. The __Estimator__ service will make use of __Map__ data to compute the ETA as per user's current location.
    - The partition of Map graph is still useful to compute ETA by considering road intersections and road segments efficiently.

![Ride Tracking Response](./Resources/HLDTrackTheRide5.png)

15. The __Map__ service can relay the response back to the __Data Fetch__ service.
16. The __Ride Estimator__ service can provide the computed ETA to the __Data Fetch__ service.
17. The __Data Fetch__ service can save user's current, drop-off location coordinates and respective ETA to the __user record__ database.
    - This step can be an optional one, because it will be a storage overhead to maintain location coordinates through out the ride path.
    - You can consider the location coordinates at the start of the ride and at the end of the ride along with their ETA. Also, you can consider this storage if Mark changes his drop-off location.

![API Gateway Response](./Resources/HLDTrackTheRide6.png)

18. The __API Gateway__ can give a response to the __Client__.
    - As we are tracking the ride, responses can be asynchronous i.e: cab sharing servers can keep-on sending responses to client as Mark's or John's current location progresses.

19. The __Client__ can store the information to the __CDN__.

20. The static information from __CDN__ can be used to render the client's User Interface(UI) until, it receives the response from backend system.

21. As Mark progressed with his ride, our __backend-system__ responded back with __updated ETA__ along with his __latest location__ details to __Client__ through __API Gateway__.

22. The __Client__ can store the information to the __CDN__.

23. The __Client retrieves__ static information that was saved in __CDN__.
    - And this process of retrieving data from backend system for data population continuous until ride completes

24. The __API Gateway__ can relay the ride completion response to the __client__.

25. The __Client__ can save the ride completion status to the __CDN__.
    - This can help Mark to view his ride status later on.

#### Final HLD for Ride Tracking:

![Track The Ride](./Resources/HLDTrackTheRideOverall.png)

## High Level Design :View Ride History

How John checked his Ride History? Let's see.

![Client Request](./Resources/HLDViewRideHistory1.png)

1. John can click __Profile__ option from Client's home page to see an option for his ride history called __Activity__.

2. As John's profile page is static, meaning options won't change often, the Client can take help from CDN to load profile page options.
    - If John is accessing his profile page for the first time, then Client can request the Cab Sharing Servers for profile page data.
    - Also, you might be wondering, what will happen if there is a change in profile page options! This case can be handled in two ways-
        1. The Cab sharing system can notify client via Notification asynchronous communication service and can re-load the page with his approval.
        2. The Cab sharing system can collect all new features for client and release them as an when application upgrade happens (preferred for hand held devices like mobile applications).

3. After loading __profile__ page, John can click __Activity__ option to send ride history request.

4. The __Client__ can relay the __Ride history__ request to the __API Gateway__.

![API-Load balancer](./Resources/HLDViewRideHistory2.png)

5. The __API gateway__ can relay the request to the __load balancer__.

6. The __Load balancer__ can direct the same request to the __Data Fetch__ service.

![Service flow](./Resources/HLDViewRideHistory3.png)

7. The __Data Fetch__ service can request __User Record__ NoSQL database for John's previous ride history.

8. The __User Record Database__ can send John's __ride history__ to the __Data Fetch__ service.

>__*Note:*__ John's ride history can have payment information associated to each and every ride of John.

![Response](./Resources/HLDViewRideHistory4.png)

9. The __API Gateway__ can relay ride history response to the __Client__.

10. __John can see__ his previous ride history along with payment information through __Client__.

11. The __Client__ can save John's ride history to the __CDN__ until John completes his next ride.
    - The reason for maintaining John's ride history until his next ride is, the Cab Sharing system can refresh the John's ride history based on his next ride status.

## DEEP DIVE INSIGHTS: Into Book A Cab Service

### View Map

We've seen how the Map service provided services to Mark and John by gathering data from different sources. Now, let's dive deeper into those sources.

#### The process of getting map information

__Intro:__

- [OpenStreetMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap): OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, open map database updated and maintained by a community of volunteers via open collaboration. For more information, you can click on the hyperlink.

- [S2 Library](http://s2geometry.io/): Unlike many geometry libraries, google's S2 is primarily designed to work with spherical geometry, i.e: shapes drawn on a sphere rather than on a planar 2D map.
    - Some of the S2 features:
        - S2 divides the map into grids called cells and gives each cell a unique ID.
        - Flexible support for spatial indexing, including the ability to estimate inconsistent regions as a collection of discrete S2 cells. This feature makes it easy to build distributed spacial indexes.
        - Fast in-memory spacial indexing of collections of points, polylines, and polygons.

- [Amazon DynamoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_DynamoDB) is a managed NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It supports key-value and document data structures. It is primarily used for scalability and performance.

__Usage:__
- We can use OSM for internal map data. It gives a free and editable map of the world.
- And can use Google’s S2 library on top of OSM to efficiently index and query map data.
- OSM can store road metadata and road segment sequences in each cell. It helps to understand turn restrictions on the road.
- OSM let the client dynamically build a road network graph for low memory usage. This means the client downloads the S2 cells based on the user's location. Besides the client buffers nearby cells to have enough map data for navigation.
- We can store map data in serialized format on DynamoDB. And query the S2 geospatial index to find the relevant DynamoDB partition. The map data then gets downloaded from DynamoDB. The map data gets deserialized and filtered before returning it to the client.

This is how Mark and John were able to see their map information.

### View ETA

We've seen how the ETA service provided services to Mark and John by following several steps. Now, let's look into into those steps.

#### The process of computing ETA

__Intro:__

- [Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)): There are two types of graphs: __directed__ and __undirected__.
    - __Directed Graph__: A directed graph G is a pair (V, E), where V is a finite set and E is a binary relation on V. The set V is called vertex set of G, and its elements are called vertices. The set E is called the edge set of G, and its elements are called edges.
    - __Undirected Graph__: In an undirected graph G = (V, E), the edge set E consists of unordered pairs of vertices, rather than ordered pairs.

- __Weighted Graph__: Graphs for which each edge has an associated weight, typically given by a weight function w: E -> R. For example, let G = (V, E) be a weighted graph with weight function w. We simply store the weight w(u, v) of the edge (u, v) -> E with vertex v in u's adjacency list.

- [Routing Algorithm(Dijkstra)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm): Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, a road network.

__Usage:__
1. Routing Algo:
    - We can relate map with a graph: every road intersection is modeled as a node, while every road segment is modeled as a directed edge.
    - ETA computation becomes finding the shortest path in a directed weighted graph.
    - Dijkstra's algorithm is known for finding the shortest path in a graph. But the time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O(n logn). And n is the number of road intersections or nodes in the graph.
    - Busiest areas like San Francisco Bay can have half a million road intersections, so Dijkstra's algo is not enough at our scale. Solution is to partition the map graph and then precomputed the best path within each partition. Thus interacting with boundaries of graph partitions is enough to find the best path.
    - Every single node in the map graph must be traversed to find the best path between 2 points. So time complexity would be the area of the circle: pi * r^2
    - While partitioning and precomputing make it more efficient.
    - It becomes possible to find the best path by interacting with only the nodes on the Map graph boundary.
    - So time complexity would be the perimeter of the circle: 2 * pi * r
    - Put another way, the time complexity to find the best path in the San Francisco Bay Area gets reduced from 500 Thousand to 700.
